I had a lot of trouble getting things to line up properly! Could definitely be refactored to be less redundant. I used padding to "cheat" things into place, but I tested on two different browsers testing the sizes. I also definitely overused div tags.

The one thing I didn't end up fixing was the hero image, which I could not get sized the way I wanted.

An important realization I had was working with flex, I tended to go one level too specific. The solution was typically to create another div to wrap around the content I was working on. It was important to realize without visible borders that I was actually working with an invisible container that housed content, even when the content itself didn't have borders!
